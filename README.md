## 🔍 Problems Identified & Solutions

### 1. Small Product Images
- **Problem:** Customers couldn't see product details clearly.
- **Impact:** Lower engagement and trust.
- **Solution:** Enlarged images from 150x150px to **500x500px** with shadow effects for depth.

### 2. Weak Call-to-Action (CTA)
- **Problem:** "Add to Cart" button was blending in.
- **Impact:** Low conversion rate; customers missed the purchase trigger.
- **Solution:** Implemented a **vibrant green (#2ecc71)** button, prominently placed and full-width on mobile.

### 3. Poor Mobile Experience
- **Problem:** High bounce rate (60%) on mobile devices.
- **Impact:** Lost sales from mobile users.
- **Solution:** Fully responsive design with touch-friendly buttons (48px minimum) and optimized layouts.

### 4. Generic Design & Colors
- **Problem:** Lack of brand identity.
- **Impact:** Low credibility.
- **Solution:** Established a modern color palette (**Charcoal, Teal, Gold**) for consistent branding.
